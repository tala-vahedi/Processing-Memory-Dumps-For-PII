# Processing-Memory-Dumps-For-PII

The extractor1.py file processes the memory dump and identifies unique strings of 5-15 characters along with the number of occurrences of each unique string. Then it displays the resulting list of strings and occurrences in a prettytable sorted by the highest number of occurrences. 

The extractor2.py file includes regular expressions that extract and report ALL the e-mail and urls found in the memory dump.
